TODO

Implement:
* pointer arithmetic
* casts
* char access/char array access/char * access

Improvements:
* #define with arguments
* fix type comparison to take into account array size
* fix return of array types
* expression and auto-cast support for all types
* periodic heap cleanup
* octal/hex character constants
* see if we can use ParserCopyPos() in other places rather than copying everything

Need test/debug:
* new/delete heap allocation
