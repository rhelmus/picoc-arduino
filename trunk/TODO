TODO

Bugs:
* assignment in declarators: int *b = &a;

Implement:
* pointer arithmetic
* ternary operator
* casts
* char access/char array access/char * access
* an easier way of checking pointers in library code
* evaluate only first argument of && and || if possible

Improvements:
* #define with arguments
* fix type comparison to take into account array size
* fix return of array types
* expression and auto-cast support for all types
* periodic heap cleanup
* octal/hex character constants
* see if we can use ParserCopyPos() in other places rather than copying everything
* check for no value returned in functions with a return value
* native pointer access?

Need test/debug:
* new/delete heap allocation
